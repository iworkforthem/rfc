# Objective

What are we doing and why? What problem will this solve? What are the goals and non-goals?

# Background

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Design Proposal

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider costs, tradeoffs, etc.

# Considerations

Does this proposal add any new dependencies, assumptions, risks, etc?

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved Questions

Seed this with open questions you require feedback on from the RFC process.
